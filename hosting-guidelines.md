# Hosting BoulderJS

BoulderJS often relies on local Boulder tech companies to act as hosts for our events. It's an excellent opportunity to engage with some of the brightest web developers in Denver/Boulder area and give back to the developer community.

In order to be a host, you must be able to provide:

* Seating for 30+
* Good and accessible Wi-Fi
* Ability to project (audio input also helps)

We ask that the room is set up by 6pm on the night of the meetup. Our organizers will arrive between 5:30 and 6 to help get things set-up and assist with any logistics that need handling.

You can check out our Meetup page and see which of our upcoming meetups does not currently have a venue. If you're interested in hosting, just follow these directions.
